    "Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used to address multicollinearity (i.e., high correlation between predictor variables) in linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, a penalty term is added to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression objective function, which minimizes the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. \n",
    "The penalty term is proportional to the square of the L2 norm of the regression coefficients, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing their magnitudes and making them less sensitive to small changes in the input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ridge Regression model seeks to find the set of coefficients that minimize the following objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "RSS + α * Σ(βi^2)\n",

    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "RSS is the residual sum of squares between the predicted and actual values\n",
    "α is the regularization parameter, which controls the strength of the penalty term. Larger values of α lead to greater shrinkage of the coefficients\n",
    "Σ(βi^2) is the sum of the squared regression coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, OLS regression does not add any penalty term to the objective function and seeks to find the set of coefficients that minimize only the residual sum of squares. \n",
    "As a result, OLS regression tends to overfit when there are many input variables or when the variables are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Ridge Regression is a regularized form of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the objective function to reduce the influence of highly correlated predictors and prevent overfitting."

    "Like any other linear regression method, Ridge Regression also has several assumptions that must be met for the model to be effective and reliable.\n",
    "Here are the key assumptions of Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: \n",
    "Ridge Regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. \n",
    "If the relationship is nonlinear, the model may not be able to capture it accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence:\n",
    "The observations should be independent of each other.\n",
    "This means that there should be no correlation between the errors of the regression model.\n",
    "Violation of this assumption can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity:\n",
    "Homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the variance of the errors should be constant across all values of the independent variables.\n",
    "If the errors have different variances across the range of the independent variables, the model may not be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Normality:\n",
    "Ridge Regression assumes that the errors are normally distributed with a mean of zero.\n",
    "Violation of this assumption can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients and inaccurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.No multicollinearity:\n",
    "Ridge Regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. \n",
    "When there is multicollinearity, the model may not be able to accurately estimate the coefficients and can lead to unstable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while Ridge Regression can handle violations of some of these assumptions to some extent, \n",
    "it is still important to ensure that the assumptions are not severely violated for the model to be reliable."

    "Therefore, selecting the right value of λ is important to balance between model complexity and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common methods for selecting the value of λ in Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Cross-validation: \n",
    "This is the most widely used method for selecting the value of λ. \n",
    "In cross-validation, the dataset is split into k-folds, and the Ridge Regression model is trained on k-1 folds and evaluated on the remaining fold.\n",
    "This process is repeated k times, with each fold used as a test set once. The average error across all the k-folds is used to select the value of λ that gives the lowest error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Grid search: \n",
    "In grid search, a range of λ values is specified, and the model is trained and evaluated for each λ value.\n",
    "The value of λ that gives the best performance on the evaluation metric is selected as the optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Analytical solution: \n",
    "There is a closed-form solution for the optimal value of λ, which can be calculated using the training data.\n",
    "However, this method is rarely used in practice due to its computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Prior knowledge:\n",
    "If there is prior knowledge about the range of values of λ that might work well for the problem, it can be used to select the value of λ.\n",
    "However, this method requires domain expertise and may not always be feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the value of λ selected using any of these methods may not be optimal for all datasets and situations.\n",
    "Therefore, it is recommended to test multiple values of λ and select the one that gives the best performance on the evaluation metric."

    "Once the optimal value of λ is obtained, the coefficients of the features with small magnitudes are set to zero, and the remaining features are selected for the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use the Lasso Regression, which is another regularization technique that can perform feature selection by setting the coefficients of less important features to zero. \n",
    "Unlike Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression uses the L1 norm of the coefficients as the penalty term, which leads to sparsity in the coefficient vector and effectively selects a subset of the features.\n",

    "Ridge Regression can effectively reduce the impact of multicollinearity on the model, but it does not completely eliminate it. \n",
