    "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric is the way they measure the distance between two points in a multi-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between each coordinate of the two points. \n",
    "It is also known as the \"straight-line\" distance or \"as the crow flies\" distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Manhattan distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each coordinate of the two points. \n",
    "It is also known as the \"taxicab\" distance, as it represents the distance that a taxicab would need to travel in a city grid-like street system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor, depending on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.\n",
    "For example, the Euclidean distance may work better for continuous variables with a normal distribution, while the Manhattan distance may work better for categorical variables or variables with a skewed distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the Euclidean distance tends to work better when the dimensions are not highly correlated, while the Manhattan distance tends to work better when the dimensions are correlated.\n",
    "Additionally, the Euclidean distance is more sensitive to outliers than the Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice of distance metric should be carefully considered when using KNN, and it may require some experimentation to determine which distance metric works best for a particular problem."
