    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two techniques commonly used in data preprocessing to transform categorical variables into numerical variables that can be used as inputs to machine learning models. \n",
    "While they may seem similar, there are some key differences between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding is a technique used when the categorical variable has some inherent ordering or hierarchy.\n",
    "In ordinal encoding, each unique category is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the ordering. \n",
    "For example, if the variable is \"education level\" and the categories are \"High School\", \"Some College\", \"Bachelor's Degree\", \"Master's Degree\", and \"PhD\", \n",
    "then ordinal encoding would assign the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to these categories respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, label encoding is a technique used when the categorical variable does not have any intrinsic ordering or hierarchy.\n",
    "In label encoding, each unique category is assigned a unique numerical value. \n",
    "For example, if the variable is \"color\" and the categories are \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", then label encoding would assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to these categories respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing between ordinal encoding and label encoding, the main consideration is whether the categorical variable has an inherent ordering or hierarchy. \n",
    "If it does, then ordinal encoding should be used. If not, then label encoding is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you are working with a dataset of movie ratings and one of the features is \"MPAA rating\", which has categories \"G\", \"PG\", \"PG-13\", \"R\", and \"NC-17\", you would use ordinal encoding because there is an inherent ordering to the ratings.\n",
    "However, if you are working with a dataset of customer demographics and one of the features is \"favorite color\", which has categories \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", you would use label encoding because there is no inherent ordering to the colors."

    "Electronics: 0.6\n",

    "It provides information about the direction of the relationship (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship (weak or strong) between two variables.\n",

    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps us understand the relationship between two variables.\n",
    "For example, in finance, covariance is used to measure the relationship between the returns of two different stocks. \n",

    "cov(X,Y) = Σ[(Xi - X̄) * (Yi - Ȳ)] / (n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X and Y are two random variables, Xi and Yi are their corresponding values, X̄ and Ȳ are the means of X and Y, and n is the number of observations.\n",

    "Alternatively, covariance can be calculated using matrix notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "cov(X,Y) = (1 / (n - 1)) * (X - X̄)ᵀ * (Y - Ȳ)\n",

    "where X and Y are column vectors of observations, X̄ and Ȳ are the means of X and Y, and ᵀ denotes the transpose of a matrix.\n",

    "It is important to note that covariance is sensitive to the scale of the variables.\n",
    "If the variables are measured in different units or have different ranges, the covariance may be difficult to interpret.\n",
