    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted class labels with the true class labels.\n",
    "The matrix contains four entries: true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN).\n",
    "\n",
    "TP represents the number of correctly predicted positive instances (i.e., instances that belong to the positive class), FP represents the number of instances that were predicted as positive but actually belong to the negative class,\n",
    "TN represents the number of correctly predicted negative instances, and FN represents the number of instances that were predicted as negative but actually belong to the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contingency matrix can be used to calculate various performance metrics for a classification model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). \n",
    "These metrics provide different perspectives on the model's performance, depending on the particular problem and application.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances, precision is the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of the total number of instances predicted as positive, \n",
    "recall is the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of the total number of actual positive instances, F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and AUC-ROC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances across different classification thresholds.\n",

    "By analyzing the contingency matrix and calculating these performance metrics, we can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a classification model and make informed decisions about how to improve it."

    "A pair confusion matrix is a type of confusion matrix that is used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier in situations where there is a class imbalance. \n",
    "In a pair confusion matrix, the entries are pairs of classes rather than individual classes, and the diagonal entries represent the number of correct predictions for each pair of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a binary classification problem where the classes are \"positive\" and \"negative\", a regular confusion matrix would have four entries: true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative.\n",
    "In contrast, a pair confusion matrix would have two diagonal entries, one for the \"positive-positive\" pair and one for the \"negative-negative\" pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using a pair confusion matrix is that it allows us to focus on the performance of the classifier for specific pairs of classes, which can be useful in situations where one class is much more prevalent than the other.\n",
    "In such situations, a regular confusion matrix may not provide enough information about the classifier's performance on the minority class, since the majority class may dominate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a pair confusion matrix, we can evaluate the performance of the classifier for each pair of classes separately, which can reveal patterns or biases in the classifier's predictions. \n",
    "For example, if the classifier is consistently misclassifying instances of the minority class as instances of the majority class, we can identify this problem more easily using a pair confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, a pair confusion matrix is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of a binary classifier in situations where there is a class imbalance, since it provides a more detailed and nuanced view of the classifier's predictions than a regular confusion matrix."

    "1.Imbalanced datasets:\n",
    "If the classes in the dataset are imbalanced, where one class has significantly more samples than the others, a model can achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class. \n",
