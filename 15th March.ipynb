    "1.Training set:\n",
    "The training set is used to train the model, and it is important to have enough data in this set to ensure that the model can learn the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "Anomalies can be detected by comparing the reconstructed data to the original data and identifying data points that have a high reconstruction error.\n",
