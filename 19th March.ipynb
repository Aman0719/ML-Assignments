    "1.Random under-sampling: \n",
    "Randomly selecting a subset of the majority class to match the size of the minority class. This approach may lead to information loss, as important data points may be removed from the majority class.\n",

    "Clustering the majority class samples and removing the samples that are closer to the cluster center. This approach preserves the information in the majority class while reducing the number of samples.\n",

    "Identifying pairs of samples from different classes that are closest to each other and removing the majority class sample. This approach can improve the model's ability to distinguish between the classes by removing noise from the majority class.\n",

    "Giving higher weights to the minority class samples during model training to balance the influence of the classes.\n",

    "7.Ensemble methods:\n",
    "Using ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, or stacking can combine multiple models to improve the overall performance on imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods using appropriate evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The choice of method depends on the dataset's characteristics and the goal of the analysis."
