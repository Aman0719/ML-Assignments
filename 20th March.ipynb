    "Data encoding refers to the process of transforming data from one format or representation to another, such as converting data from a text-based format to a binary format that can be read by a computer.\n",
    "This transformation is important for various reasons, including data compression, data security, and efficient data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, data encoding is particularly useful in tasks such as machine learning and data analysis.\n",
    "For example, in machine learning, the input data often needs to be encoded in a way that the machine learning algorithm can understand and process. \n",
    "This may involve transforming the data into a numerical representation, such as converting text data to numerical vectors using techniques such as one-hot encoding or word embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding can also be useful in data analysis tasks such as data cleansing and transformation.\n",
    "For instance, encoding categorical data using numerical values allows for easier comparison and analysis of data, as well as easier processing by machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "An example of how nominal encoding can be used in a real-world scenario is in analyzing customer feedback data for a product or service. \n",

    "To perform analysis on this data, we would need to convert the categorical values of positive, neutral, and negative into numerical values.\n",
    "We can do this using nominal encoding by assigning each category a unique integer value, such as positive = 1, neutral = 2, and negative = 3.\n",

    "Once the categorical values have been encoded in this way, we can perform analysis on the data using numerical techniques such as mean, standard deviation, and regression analysis.\n",
