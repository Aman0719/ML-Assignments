    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data, and violating these assumptions can lead to inaccurate results. \n",
    "Here are the main assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity: \n",
    "The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. \n",
    "This means that the slope of the line connecting the two variables is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence:\n",
    "The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. \n",
    "This means that the value of one observation does not affect the value of another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity: \n",
    "The variance of the dependent variable is constant across all levels of the independent variable. \n",
    "This means that the spread of the data points is the same at all levels of the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Normality:\n",
    "The residuals (the difference between the predicted values and the actual values) are normally distributed.\n",
    "This means that the majority of the residuals are close to zero, and the residuals follow a bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.No multicollinearity:\n",
    "There is no perfect correlation between the independent variables.\n",
    "This means that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, we can use several methods, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Plotting the data:\n",
    "We can create scatter plots of the independent variables against the dependent variable and visually inspect the relationship between them.\n",
    "If the relationship appears to be non-linear, we may need to transform the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Residual plots: \n",
    "We can plot the residuals against the predicted values and look for patterns in the data. \n",
    "If the residuals are randomly scattered around zero, then the assumption of homoscedasticity is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Normal probability plots:\n",
    "We can create a normal probability plot of the residuals and look for a straight line.\n",
    "If the line is straight, then the residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Variance inflation factor (VIF):\n",
    "We can calculate the VIF for each independent variable to check for multicollinearity. \n",
    "If the VIF is high for any variable, then there may be a problem with multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Durbin-Watson test: \n",
    "This test checks for autocorrelation in the residuals. If the test statistic is close to 2, then there is no autocorrelation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining these methods, we can determine whether the assumptions of linear regression hold in a given dataset. \n",
    "If we find that some of the assumptions are violated, we may need to use alternative models or transform the variables to meet the assumptions."
